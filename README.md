# Student-Report-Management-System

This is a project which i demonstrated with the help of my C++ skills. I created a simple report management system where
- [x]  The student can record his report,
- [x]  Search his record In this project, 
- [x]  Display all students records                                                                                                         
- [x]  Delete student record                                                                                                                 
- [x]  Modify student record  
 
we can learn a lot about input/output streams and the file management system of C++. 
Our program collects student details like name, roll number, marks in each subject, and calculates their grade.
This is a simple console app.
